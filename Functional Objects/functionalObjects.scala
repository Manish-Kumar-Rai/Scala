/*
One, maybe rather trivial, observation is that in mathematics, rational
numbers do not have mutable state. You can add one rational number to
another, but the result will be a new rational number.
*/

// ---- Constructing a Rational

/*
The Scala compiler will compile any code you place in the class body,
which isnâ€™t part of a field or a method definition, into the primary constructor
*/

/*
In Scala, constructors other than the primary constructor are called auxiliary constructors.
